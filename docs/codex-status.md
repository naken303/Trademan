# Codex Project Status

## Last Updated

- Date: 2026-09-10
- Commit: This commit (`Complete UX and release cleanup`)
- Branch: main

## Current Phase

- Phase: Non-optimizer release readiness
- Current Task: UX and release cleanup
- Task Status: `completed`

## Repository Status

- Working Tree: Clean after this commit.
- Latest Commit: This commit (`Complete UX and release cleanup`)
- Notes: The implemented non-optimizer application is release-ready; Optimizer remains intentionally out of scope.

## Changes In Last Task

- Files changed: Lazy app routing/navigation/layout; World, Village, Market, and Settings UX/error handling; E2E navigation assertion; release smoke checklist; this status note.
- What changed: Standardized visible copy/actions and page spacing, added recoverable failure states, corrected Market image URLs, and split implemented pages into lazy chunks.
- Why: Make the completed non-optimizer application coherent and ready for release verification.
- Behavior affected: Navigation is ordered consistently, failures remain readable/recoverable, and the initial production bundle no longer triggers Vite's 500 kB warning.

## Known Issues

1. Critical
   - Location: N/A
   - Problem: No critical issue has been verified.
   - Impact: N/A
   - Recommended action: Continue to verify after each scoped change.

2. Low
   - Location: N/A
   - Problem: No low-priority release issue has been verified.
   - Impact: N/A
   - Recommended action: Begin the Optimizer phase as a separate bounded task.

## Completed Milestones

- Shared TypeScript types and Zod schemas for world data.
- Domain helpers for products, crates, inventory, routes, and markets.
- Simulation state, reset timing, inventory operations, and buy/sell systems.
- SQLite migrations, transactional demo-world import, repositories, and world API.
- World editor shell, product CRUD/image upload, market management, and village-management work.
- TypeScript village-position contract build blocker fixed in commit `49a3981`.
- Foundation hardening: ESM world route import, Village visual persistence, configurable WorldData persistence, partial-sale accounting, reset validation, isolated test SQLite, and lint fixes.
- Initial inventory uses explicit per-unit cost and is covered through persistence, simulation initialization, partial/full sales, multiple products, and zero-cost inventory tests.
- World and Village routes are covered through isolated HTTP regression tests using `createApp()` and an ephemeral local listener.
- Route Management supports repository/API/client CRUD with shared validation and HTTP/contract regression coverage.
- Simulation UI uses a thin controller/Zustand layer over the existing engine, including reverse-route fallback and travel-driven resets.
- Full WorldData export/import and local JSON backup creation are available through the server and Database & Settings page.
- World/player/simulation/optimization settings and initial inventory are editable and persist through the existing transactional importer.
- Playwright E2E covers app navigation, Simulation initialization, buy/travel/sell UI flow, and rejected-import persistence safety.
- Deterministic simulation scenarios cover money, crates, inventory cost basis, realized profit, resets across travel, and all reverse-route cases.
- Non-optimizer UX/release cleanup is complete, including consistent navigation/copy, recoverable page errors, lazy route chunks, and a manual smoke checklist.

## Remaining Work

1. Optimizer implementation.

## Important Notes For ChatGPT

- Initial inventory entries require `{ productId, quantity, unitCost }`; runtime `inventoryCost` is initialized as `quantity * unitCost` per product.
- Migration `003_initial_inventory_unit_cost.sql` preserves existing databases and explicitly maps legacy rows without recorded cost to `unitCost = 0`.
- `createApp()` owns Express/database setup; `server.ts` owns only port selection and listening.
- Route validation rejects self-routes and zero travel duration; reverse-route fallback remains exclusively in domain/simulation code.
- Simulation UI initializes from persisted WorldData, but all runtime mutations remain in memory and restart from the saved world on reload/restart.
- Simulation actions call `SimulationEngine` through `SimulationController`; React does not advance time, reset villages, or mutate trade state directly.
- Export and backup serialize persisted WorldData only; runtime Simulation state is excluded.
- Import is validated with the shared Zod schema before the existing SQLite transaction runs; schema and database failures leave the prior world unchanged.
- Tests pass explicit temporary directories to backup creation and do not touch the real `backups/` directory or runtime SQLite database.
- `npm run test` excludes `tests/e2e/**`; `npm run e2e` owns Playwright execution and its automatic isolated web servers.
- E2E backend startup creates a temporary SQLite database and backup directory, seeds the demo world deterministically, and cleans them on shutdown.
- World Editor continues to load persisted villages, positions, routes, markets, and products; position saves refresh the persisted aggregate and expose save failures inline.
- Page-level lazy loading reduced the largest generated JavaScript chunk to approximately 233 kB in the latest build.
- Do not re-import the demo world during server startup; SQLite runtime state must survive restart.
- Shared types and Zod schemas are the contract between client, server, simulation, and persistence.
- The optimizer's primary objective is accumulated profit; continuous selling is only a tie-break preference.
- Latest verification: build without chunk warnings, 43 Vitest tests, lint, and 3 Playwright E2E tests pass.
