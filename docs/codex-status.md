## Changes In Last Task

- Files changed: Dark-blue theme and responsive shell; World canvas/palette/dialog UI; route/market validation and uniqueness checks; server and E2E regressions; this status note.
- What changed: Added directional drag-connect route editing, product drag/drop market assignment, duplicate-aware edit dialogs, server-side logical uniqueness, positive market validation, and cohesive responsive dark styling.
- Why: Make visual world setup faster while keeping Routes and Markets as accessible table-management alternatives.
- Behavior affected: Confirmed canvas mutations persist through existing APIs and refresh immediately; duplicate routes/markets return 409, and market price/quantity must be positive.

## Known Issues

1. Critical
   - Location: N/A
   - Problem: No critical issue has been verified.
   - Impact: N/A
   - Recommended action: Continue to verify after each scoped change.

2. Low
   - Location: `src/client/features/world/world-history.ts`
   - Problem: Undo/redo covers unsaved village positions only; persisted route and market mutations are not reversible from the World toolbar.
   - Impact: Users must edit a route/market again or use its management page; the canvas never presents UI-only state that disagrees with SQLite.
   - Recommended action: Add persisted entity command history only as a separate transactional feature if required.

## Completed Milestones

- Shared TypeScript types and Zod schemas for world data.
- Domain helpers for products, crates, inventory, routes, and markets.
- Simulation state, reset timing, inventory operations, and buy/sell systems.
- SQLite migrations, transactional demo-world import, repositories, and world API.
- World editor shell, product CRUD/image upload, market management, and village-management work.
- TypeScript village-position contract build blocker fixed in commit `49a3981`.
- Foundation hardening: ESM world route import, Village visual persistence, configurable WorldData persistence, partial-sale accounting, reset validation, isolated test SQLite, and lint fixes.
- Initial inventory uses explicit per-unit cost and is covered through persistence, simulation initialization, partial/full sales, multiple products, and zero-cost inventory tests.
- World and Village routes are covered through isolated HTTP regression tests using `createApp()` and an ephemeral local listener.
- Route Management supports repository/API/client CRUD with shared validation and HTTP/contract regression coverage.
- Simulation UI uses a thin controller/Zustand layer over the existing engine, including reverse-route fallback and travel-driven resets.
- Full WorldData export/import and local JSON backup creation are available through the server and Database & Settings page.
- World/player/simulation/optimization settings and initial inventory are editable and persist through the existing transactional importer.
- Playwright E2E covers app navigation, Simulation initialization, buy/travel/sell UI flow, and rejected-import persistence safety.
- Deterministic simulation scenarios cover money, crates, inventory cost basis, realized profit, resets across travel, and all reverse-route cases.
- Non-optimizer UX/release cleanup is complete, including consistent navigation/copy, recoverable page errors, lazy route chunks, and a manual smoke checklist.
- Optimizer core searches bounded simulation-backed buy/sell/travel plans with deterministic state signatures, beam retention, per-run caching, and search statistics.
- Optimizer Worker/API integration runs one isolated search worker per request with bounded overrides, timeout cleanup, and authoritative repository WorldData.
- Optimizer UI runs the Worker-backed API with validated limits and presents named plan actions, final runtime state, and search statistics.
- Optimizer hardening verifies plan replay, deterministic ordering, material state signatures, multi-product crate use, reset-sensitive travel, initial inventory cost basis, cyclic termination, and bounded search statistics.
- A centralized dark-blue token system, desktop sidebar, accessible mobile drawer, consistent controls/data surfaces, and responsive layouts cover all implemented pages.
- World Editor supports directional route connection/edit dialogs and product-palette drag/drop market creation/editing with immediate persisted refresh.

## Remaining Work

1. Final UI/UX integration review and release verification.

## Important Notes For ChatGPT

- Initial inventory entries require `{ productId, quantity, unitCost }`; runtime `inventoryCost` is initialized as `quantity * unitCost` per product.
- Migration `003_initial_inventory_unit_cost.sql` preserves existing databases and explicitly maps legacy rows without recorded cost to `unitCost = 0`.
- `createApp()` owns Express/database setup; `server.ts` owns only port selection and listening.
- Route validation rejects self-routes and zero travel duration; reverse-route fallback remains exclusively in domain/simulation code.
- Simulation UI initializes from persisted WorldData, but all runtime mutations remain in memory and restart from the saved world on reload/restart.
- Simulation actions call `SimulationEngine` through `SimulationController`; React does not advance time, reset villages, or mutate trade state directly.
- Export and backup serialize persisted WorldData only; runtime Simulation state is excluded.
- Import is validated with the shared Zod schema before the existing SQLite transaction runs; schema and database failures leave the prior world unchanged.
- Tests pass explicit temporary directories to backup creation and do not touch the real `backups/` directory or runtime SQLite database.
- `npm run test` excludes `tests/e2e/**`; `npm run e2e` owns Playwright execution and its automatic isolated web servers.
- E2E backend startup creates a temporary SQLite database and backup directory, seeds the demo world deterministically, and cleans them on shutdown.
- World Editor continues to load persisted villages, positions, routes, markets, and products; position saves refresh the persisted aggregate and expose save failures inline.
- Page-level lazy loading reduced the largest generated JavaScript chunk to approximately 233 kB in the latest build.
- Optimizer transitions instantiate the existing `SimulationEngine` from each candidate state; cash, capacity, market, reserve, reset, travel, reverse-route, and profit rules are not duplicated.
- Optimizer state signatures include time/location, player money, sorted inventory and cost basis, every village timer/reserve, all runtime market quantities, and accumulated realized profit.
- Frontier ranking uses unrealized liquidation potential only as a tie-break heuristic; result profit remains `SimulationState.accumulatedProfit`, and exact global optimality is not claimed.
- `POST /api/optimizer/run` accepts only `periodDays`, `beamWidth`, `maxSteps`, and `maxExpandedStates`; persisted settings provide omitted defaults and all effective values are checked against explicit API maxima.
- The Worker never imports database code; the server loads WorldData before spawning it, and each run owns its search state/cache.
- Worker bootstrap prefers a compiled `.js` entry and falls back to the repository's current TypeScript/ESM runtime; a post-build standalone worker smoke returned a profitable result.
- Optimizer UI loads persisted optimization/player/world settings from the existing world endpoint and never sends WorldData to the optimizer API.
- Optimizer plan prices and travel durations are presentation details resolved from persisted markets/routes; profit and final runtime state come directly from `OptimizerResult`.
- Production optimization remains bounded beam search: accumulated realized profit is primary, unsold inventory is not realized profit, continuous mode is tie-break only, and exact global optimality is not guaranteed.
- Identical valid WorldData/options produce the same plan and material final state; only `statistics.elapsedMs` is wall-clock dependent.
- Search limits (`periodDays`, `beamWidth`, `maxSteps`, and `maxExpandedStates`) bound runtime/state growth; the cache remains isolated per run/Worker.
- A deliberately tiny exhaustive helper exists only in optimizer tests to compare maximum realized profit on safely bounded worlds; it is not exported to production.
- Route logical uniqueness is `from + to`; reverse routes remain separate. Market logical uniqueness is `villageId + productId + side`, so Supply and Demand may coexist.
- Canvas route/market mutations call existing client APIs and reload authoritative WorldData only after server success; cancel never persists temporary interaction state.
- Product palette filtering is local, drag payloads use `application/x-village-trade-product`, and only village nodes accept them.
- Responsive browser inspection covered all main pages at 1440 px, plus representative layouts at 1024, 768, and 390 px with no page-level horizontal overflow.
- Do not re-import the demo world during server startup; SQLite runtime state must survive restart.
- Shared types and Zod schemas are the contract between client, server, simulation, and persistence.
- The optimizer's primary objective is accumulated profit; continuous selling is only a tie-break preference.
- Latest verification: build without chunk warnings, 66 Vitest tests, lint, and 7 Playwright E2E tests passed.
